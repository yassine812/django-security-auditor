"""Requirements status engine.

Core rule (spec 7 / 45): *absence of findings is never proof of compliance*.
A requirement is PASS only when at least one executed automated check produced
positive ("ok") evidence and the requirement is fully automatable.  Otherwise
the engine degrades gracefully to PARTIAL / NOT_TESTED / MANUAL_REVIEW.

Status logic per requirement:

* automation MANUAL / NOT_AUTOMATABLE           -> MANUAL_REVIEW
* any executed evidence with polarity "vuln"    -> FAIL
* else executed "ok" evidence:
    - FULLY_AUTOMATED                           -> PASS
    - PARTIALLY_AUTOMATED                       -> PARTIAL
* else (no executed evidence)                   -> NOT_TESTED
  (with a note listing scanners that were mapped but unavailable)
